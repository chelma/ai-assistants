## Phase 1: Setup & Planning ✅
**Outcome**: Research plan created with 10 analysis categories. Files to analyze: plan.md (298 lines) + progress.md (1089 lines) = ~64K tokens total.

**Key setup decisions**:
- Using Write tool for all file creation (autonomous operation, no bash append)
- 3-chunk analysis with separate findings files (findings_part1.md, findings_part2.md, findings_part3.md)
- Focus on evidence-based observations with line references
- Historical context advantage: can compare to what was learned in later extractions

## Phase 2: Reconnaissance ✅
**Outcome**: Both source files read completely. Structure assessed: well-organized 7-section plan with 3-phase approach + 1089-line progress file documenting 8-phase execution.

**Key observations**:
- Plan: 3 phases (Reconnaissance → Iterative Analysis → Human-Led Refinement)
- Execution: 8 phases (plan followed through Phase 2, then expanded organically)
- Rich documentation: Extensive phase deep-dives (226 lines Phase 3, 108 lines Phase 4, 75 lines Phase 5, 68 lines Phase 6, 148 lines Phase 7, 207 lines Phase 8)
- Clear evolution: Plan → Execution shows organic adaptation

## Phase 3: Deep Investigation ✅
**Outcome**: Three findings files created analyzing all 10 categories with evidence-based observations.

**Findings files created**:
- `findings_part1.md`: Categories 1-3 (Planning Quality, Checkpoint Effectiveness, Progress File Usage) - comprehensive analysis with line references
- `findings_part2.md`: Categories 4-7 (Deviation Handling, Human Collaboration, Resumability, Documentation Depth) - detailed evidence collection
- `findings_part3.md`: Categories 8-10 (Task Adaptations, Meta-Observations, Template Utilization) - critical emergence analysis

**Analysis approach**: Extracted specific examples with line references, identified patterns across categories, assessed strengths and gaps, maintained historical context (first major extraction).

## Phase 4: Analysis & Synthesis ✅
**Outcome**: Cross-category themes identified, patterns synthesized across all 10 categories.

**Key themes emerged**:
1. Appropriate planning for novel tasks (structure without over-constraint)
2. Checkpoint pattern emerged organically (not explicitly labeled but embedded in workflow)
3. Human collaboration drove quality (approval gates → expertise injection)
4. Documentation evolved toward teaching (execution tracking → process guide)
5. Organic phase emergence healthy (3 → 8 phases, quality-driven)
6. Template partially fit task type (some sections critical, some unused)
7. Resumability weak for cold starts (30-45min context rebuild needed)
8. Process documentation created reusable value (7-step templates established)

## Phase 5: Deliverable Creation ✅
**Outcome**: Comprehensive summary.md created for main session (<20K tokens as specified).

**Summary structure**:
- Executive summary (key success factors, major gap, core insight)
- Key findings by category (10 categories, each with assessment and evidence)
- Cross-cutting themes (8 themes identified)
- Recommendations for tag-team skill (10 improvements, prioritized)
- Evidence quality assessment
- Links to detailed findings files

**Token count**: Summary ~15K tokens (within <20K target), detailed findings ~65K tokens total across 3 files.

## Phase 6: Summary & Handoff ✅
**Outcome**: Research complete, summary ready for main session.

**Deliverables**:
1. `plan.md` - Research plan with 10 categories
2. `progress.md` - This file (research tracking)
3. `findings_part1.md` - Categories 1-3 detailed analysis
4. `findings_part2.md` - Categories 4-7 detailed analysis
5. `findings_part3.md` - Categories 8-10 detailed analysis
6. `summary.md` - Executive summary for main session

**Key findings for main session**:
- **What worked**: Appropriate flexibility, organic checkpoints, human collaboration, documentation evolution, meta-awareness
- **What needs improvement**: Resumability for cold starts, template framing ("Deviations" assumes problems), underutilized sections (Gotchas)
- **Core insight**: For first-of-kind tasks, organic phase emergence > rigid plan adherence
- **Major gap**: 30-45min context rebuild after /compact (could be 10min with "Resume from Here" section)

## Context Health (Final)
**Current context usage**: Moderate (setup + reconnaissance + 3 analysis chunks + synthesis + summary creation)
**Files read directly**: 5 files (2 source files + 3 findings files for synthesis)
**Files written**: 6 files (plan, progress, 3 findings, summary)
**Explore agent calls**: 0
**Risk assessment**: 🟢 Green - completed within capacity

## Research Quality
**Evidence-based**: ✅ All observations backed by specific line references
**Quantitative**: ✅ File counts, line counts, metrics throughout
**Balanced**: ✅ Identified strengths and gaps
**Actionable**: ✅ 10 prioritized recommendations for tag-team improvement
**Comprehensive**: ✅ All 10 categories analyzed thoroughly
