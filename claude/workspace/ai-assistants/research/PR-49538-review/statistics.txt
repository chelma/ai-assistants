## Asymmetric Files (insertions ≠ deletions)

**Total Count**: 3 files (0.06% of total files)

### File 1: app/services/billing/troubleshoot/insurance/new_york_medicaid_reject.rb
- **Insertions**: 3
- **Deletions**: 8
- **Difference**: 5 deletions
- **Explanation**: Removed orphaned sig + initialize method (redundant with parent class)
- **Risk**: None - legitimate cleanup

### File 2: app/services/billing/troubleshoot/insurance/days_supply_below_plan_minimum.rb
- **Insertions**: 1
- **Deletions**: 6
- **Difference**: 5 deletions
- **Explanation**: Removed orphaned sig + initialize method (redundant with parent class)
- **Risk**: None - legitimate cleanup

### File 3: spec/services/scheduling/delivery_windows/policies/resolve_default_spec.rb
- **Insertions**: 13
- **Deletions**: 12
- **Difference**: 1 insertion
- **Explanation**: Multi-line hash reformatting caused line count difference
- **Risk**: None - formatting only

## Orphaned Sig Removals

**Total sig declarations removed**: 2
- app/services/billing/troubleshoot/insurance/new_york_medicaid_reject.rb (1 sig)
- app/services/billing/troubleshoot/insurance/days_supply_below_plan_minimum.rb (1 sig)

**Analysis**: Both removed methods only called `super` with same parameters. This is redundant since parent class `Strategy` already defines the signature. Removal is appropriate cleanup.

## Statistical Outliers

**Definition**: Files with >2 standard deviations from mean change count

**Standard Deviation**: ~15.7 lines (calculated from distribution)
**Outlier Threshold**: >37 lines changed

**Files exceeding threshold**: 45 files (0.9% of total)

**Top outlier**: app/services/prescriptions/commands.rb (189 lines)
- Expected for large service files with many hash literals
- No security concern - proportional to file size

## Conclusion

**Distribution**: Normal for automated syntax conversion
**Asymmetry Rate**: 0.06% (3/4815 files) - all explained
**Outliers**: Expected for large files with many hashes
**Risk Assessment**: No statistical anomalies detected
