## Phase 1: Setup & Planning ✅

**Outcome**: Research plan created. Both plan and progress files read completely (~64K tokens). Workspace detected as time-cop (cross-workspace analysis). Ready to begin category analysis.

**Files Read**:
- Plan: ~/.claude/workspace/time-cop/tasks/2025-11-07-extract-temporal-workflow-pattern_plan.md (369 lines)
- Progress: ~/.claude/workspace/time-cop/tasks/2025-11-07-extract-temporal-workflow-pattern_progress.md (888 lines)

## Phase 2: Chunk 1 Analysis (Categories 1-3) ✅

**Outcome**: Analyzed Planning Quality, Checkpoint Effectiveness, and Progress File Usage. Created findings_part1.md with detailed evidence-based observations.

**Key findings**:
- Planning Quality: Grade A (comprehensive, detailed, risk-assessed, evidence of maturation)
- Checkpoint Effectiveness: Grade A (consistent pattern, strategic reviews, appropriate frequency)
- Progress File Usage: Grade A- (all sections utilized, one violation: batched updates)

**File created**: findings_part1.md (~23K tokens)

## Phase 3: Chunk 2 Analysis (Categories 4-7) ✅

**Outcome**: Analyzed Deviation Handling, Human Collaboration, Resumability, and Documentation Depth. Created findings_part2.md with specific examples.

**Key findings**:
- Deviation Handling: Grade A (structured, well-managed, clear rationale)
- Human Collaboration: Grade A (strategic, focused, effective rhythm)
- Resumability: Grade A (excellent at phase boundaries, self-contained state)
- Documentation Depth: Grade A (balanced, concrete, lessons captured)

**File created**: findings_part2.md (~19K tokens)

## Phase 4: Chunk 3 Analysis (Categories 8-10) ✅

**Outcome**: Analyzed Task-Specific Adaptations, Meta-Observations, and Template Utilization. Created findings_part3.md with evolution analysis.

**Key findings**:
- Task Adaptations: Grade A (flexible framework, patterns stabilized, cross-workspace portable)
- Meta-Observations: Grade A (high self-awareness, systematic learning, process maturing)
- Template Utilization: Grade A (all sections used appropriately, mature template ~90% stable)

**File created**: findings_part3.md (~21K tokens)

## Phase 5: Synthesis & Summary ✅

**Outcome**: Created summary.md consolidating all findings with executive summary, cross-category patterns, evolution analysis, and recommendations.

**Overall assessment**:
- Grade: A (9 categories A, 1 category A-)
- Process maturity: ~90% stable
- Stabilized patterns: 4 (iteration planning, human collaboration, token optimization, priority framework)
- Emerging refinements: 2 (incremental updates, format choice timing)

**Recommendations identified**:
- HIGH priority: Emphasize incremental progress file updates, add Phase 4.5 "Choose Output Format"
- MODERATE priority: Revise Phase 8, add acceptance criteria tracking
- MINOR priority: Session timestamps, deviations threshold clarification

**File created**: summary.md (~18K tokens)

## Phase 6: Handoff ✅

**Outcome**: Investigation complete. All deliverables created and ready for main session review.

## Context Health
**Final context usage**: moderate (81K tokens total)
**Files created**: 5 (plan.md, progress.md, findings_part1.md, findings_part2.md, findings_part3.md, summary.md)
**Risk assessment**: green (investigation completed successfully)

## Deliverables Summary

**Research files created**:
1. `plan.md` - Research objectives and analysis categories
2. `progress.md` - This file (phase tracking)
3. `findings_part1.md` - Categories 1-3 analysis (~23K tokens)
4. `findings_part2.md` - Categories 4-7 analysis (~19K tokens)
5. `findings_part3.md` - Categories 8-10 analysis (~21K tokens)
6. `summary.md` - Executive summary and recommendations (<20K tokens)

**Total investigation output**: ~81K tokens across 6 files

**File structure**:
```

## Key Insights

**Process maturity**: ~90% stable by third extraction
- 4 major patterns stabilized (iteration planning, human collaboration, token optimization, priority framework)
- 2 refinements emerging (incremental updates, format choice timing)
- Trajectory: ~95% stable by fourth extraction

**Evolution observed**: From reactive to proactive
- Human collaboration anticipated upfront (not discovered ad-hoc)
- Token optimization planned (not reactive)
- Risk assessment comprehensive (learning from earlier extractions)

**Cross-workspace portability**: ~95% workspace-agnostic
- Core framework unchanged across workspaces
- Only project paths and file references change
- Template structure universal

**Recommendations for tag-team skill**:
1. Emphasize incremental progress file updates (HIGH)
2. Add Phase 4.5 "Choose Output Format & Structure" (HIGH)
3. Revise Phase 8 "Process Documentation" (MODERATE)
4. Add acceptance criteria tracking to header (MINOR)
