# Implementation: [Task Name]

<!--
RESUMABILITY: This file is the authoritative state document. When starting a fresh
Claude Code session (/compact, new day, etc.), Claude will read this file to understand:
- What's been completed (checked boxes, phase outcomes)
- Current blockers and decisions made
- Where to pick up next

For complex multi-phase work, consider grouping progress by phase and documenting
outcomes: what was accomplished, key decisions, metrics, what's next.

See .agents/README.md sections "Resumability" and "Documenting Phase Outcomes" for details.

## Progress

<!--
For simple linear work, check off steps as you complete them.
For complex multi-phase work, consider organizing by phase:

### Phase 1: [Name] ✅/⏳/[ ]
- [✅] Step 1
- [✅] Step 2

**Outcome**: What was accomplished, key decisions, what's next

### Phase 2: [Name] ⏳
- [ ] Step 3
